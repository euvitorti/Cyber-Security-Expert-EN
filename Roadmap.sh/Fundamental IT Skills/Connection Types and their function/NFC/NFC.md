# NFC and Cybersecurity

**NFC (Near Field Communication)** is a short-range wireless communication technology that allows data exchange between nearby devices, typically within a distance of up to 10 centimeters. It is widely used in mobile payments (such as Google Pay or Apple Pay), public transport cards, entry tickets, and other forms of proximity authentication.

## Importance of Learning about NFC in Cybersecurity

- **Growing usage**: With the rise of mobile payments and the Internet of Things (IoT), NFC-enabled devices are becoming more common. Learning about the security of these devices and NFC connections is crucial to protect sensitive data.
- **Proximity vulnerabilities**: Although communication is limited to short distances, it is not immune to attacks. The focus of cybersecurity should be on protecting the transmitted data.
- **Risks with malicious devices**: There is a risk of counterfeit or malicious NFC devices that could be used to intercept or alter communication between two legitimate devices.

## Types of Vulnerabilities in NFC

1. **Sniffing (Data Interception)**:
   - NFC communication can be intercepted by nearby devices. If the data is not properly encrypted, an attacker could capture sensitive information, such as banking data or access credentials.

2. **Replay Attacks**:
   - An attacker can record communication between two legitimate devices and retransmit it to perform unauthorized actions, such as making payments or accessing systems.

3. **Device Spoofing**:
   - Counterfeit NFC devices may try to impersonate legitimate devices, carrying out fraudulent transactions.

4. **Denial of Service (DoS)**:
   - An attacker could overwhelm an NFC device with excessive requests, making it unable to respond or function correctly.

## Attacks on NFC Connections

- **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks**:
  - An attacker places themselves between two NFC devices and intercepts or alters the communication. If encryption is not properly implemented, the data can be read or manipulated.

- **NFC Trojan**:
  - Malware installed on mobile devices or NFC readers allows an attacker to control or monitor transactions without the userâ€™s knowledge.

- **Brute Force Attacks**:
  - An attacker attempts to guess credentials or authentication keys in NFC systems if there are no proper protections in place, such as attempt limits or strong encryption algorithms.

## Why Learn about NFC in Cybersecurity

With the increased use of mobile devices and the digitization of payments and authentication, NFC technologies have become a target for criminals. Understanding the vulnerabilities and protection methods of these technologies helps mitigate risks and ensure the security of data and transactions. Cybersecurity is an ever-evolving field, and learning about NFC is essential to protect valuable information in the context of payments, identity, and IoT.
