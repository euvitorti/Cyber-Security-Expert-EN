# Wi-Fi: Concept, Functioning, and Cybersecurity

## What is Wi-Fi?
- **Definition**:  
  - Wi-Fi is a wireless networking technology that allows devices to connect to the internet and local networks through radio waves.
- **Standards and Protocols**:  
  - It is based on the IEEE 802.11 family of standards (such as 802.11a, 802.11b, 802.11g, 802.11n, 802.11ac, and 802.11ax), which define the frequencies, speeds, and methods of data transmission.

## How Does Wi-Fi Work?
- **Data Transmission**:  
  - A router or access point converts internet data into radio signals and transmits them using frequencies (usually 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz).
- **Signal Reception**:  
  - Devices equipped with Wi-Fi adapters capture these signals and convert them back into data.
- **Network Infrastructure**:  
  - It enables wireless communication between multiple devices connected to the same network, eliminating the need for physical cables.

## Wi-Fi in the Context of Cybersecurity
### Common Vulnerabilities
- **Weak Encryption**:  
  - Older protocols, such as WEP, are susceptible to attacks and can be easily cracked.
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks**:  
  - Interception of communication between the user and the router, allowing attackers to capture sensitive information.
- **Rogue Access Points (Rogue AP)**:  
  - Criminals can set up fake Wi-Fi networks that mimic legitimate networks to collect user data.
- **Sniffing and Eavesdropping**:  
  - Techniques that intercept data packets transmitted on the network, allowing unauthorized viewing of unprotected information.
- **Exploitation of Firmware Vulnerabilities**:  
  - Routers with outdated firmware may have holes that allow unauthorized access.

### Mitigation Measures and Best Practices
- **Use of Secure Protocols**:  
  - Use WPA2 or, preferably, WPA3, which offer robust encryption and improvements over previous versions.
- **Constant Updates**:  
  - Keep the router and device firmware up to date to fix known vulnerabilities.
- **Configuration of Strong Passwords**:  
  - Use complex, unique passwords to prevent unauthorized access to the network.
- **Network Monitoring**:  
  - Implement tools that detect suspicious activities and allow for quick responses to incidents.
- **User Education**:  
  - Educate users on the risks of connecting to unknown networks and the best security practices.

## Final Considerations

- Although Wi-Fi is essential for modern connectivity, it also presents cybersecurity risks that must be managed with technical and behavioral measures.
- A combination of robust encryption, regular updates, monitoring, and user awareness is key to maintaining a secure wireless network.
