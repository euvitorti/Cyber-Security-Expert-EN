# Cybersecurity Documentation: Roadmap.sh & TryHackMe

Welcome to the repository documenting my studies in cybersecurity, based on the [Cyber Security roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/cyber-security) and TryHackMe challenges. Here, you will find a compilation of notes, references, and practices that encompass both the theory and practical application of cybersecurity concepts.

## Repository Content

- **Networking Fundamentals:**  
  Essential concepts about communication, protocols, and network structure, fundamental for any security professional.

- **Offensive Cybersecurity:**  
  Pentesting techniques and vulnerability analysis, focusing on identifying and exploiting flaws in systems.

- **Defensive Cybersecurity (SOC):**  
  Strategies for monitoring, log analysis, and implementing measures to protect IT environments against attacks.

- **Practical Exercises and Case Studies:**  
  Challenges and practical projects that help consolidate theoretical knowledge and test the effectiveness of security measures.

## Practical Project: Iterative API Security

To follow the practical part focused on API security, check the [Iterative API Security](https://github.com/euvitorti/API-Cybersecurity-From-Vulnerability-to-Defense) repository. In it, you will find:

- **Iterative Learning Cycle:**  
  A complete process that shows the continuous evolution of an API, from its creation to the implementation of security improvements based on testing.

- **Tests and Practical Tools:**  
  Application of tools such as Burp Suite, Nmap, Wireshark, and others to identify and fix vulnerabilities, as well as log analysis and monitoring with SIEM.

- **Implementation of Security Measures:**  
  Each iteration introduces new practices, such as authentication, data validation, protection against attacks, and other essential techniques for strengthening systems.

## How to Navigate

- **Folders and Files:**  
  The repository is organized into directories that cover each topic and phase of the study, making it easy to consult and deepen the content.
